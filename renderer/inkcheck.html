                                <p class="text"> As a Java developer, Android always scratched a part of my mind. I had the chance to implement some little POC projects, but I have never had the time to dive into the details. Hopefully with this program I will have the possibility to learn from experienced developers.
I have plans to use this knowledge in an educational project. We have a developer crew (4 devs, 2 UI maniacs, 1 marketing expert) working on an IoT project (similar to: https://grovegrown.com/). We are planning to implement an android client to our system to communicate with the target hardver over MQTT.
This is a fully nonprofit project and we are hoping that we can give something to the educational system (here at Hungary) by showing this to kids and parents.
To achive this the first step is to learn about Android. I hope this scolarship can help me on this path.

I can not imagine a better chance to learn than a scholarship. :)
I am open-minded and I think education is the key to improve the future.
In addition I could use the knowledge the way I described. </p>
